# 🎯 Guess My Number Game

This is a simple **"Guess My Number"** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🚀 Overview

In this game, the computer randomly selects a secret number between **1 and 20**. The player’s goal is to guess that number. After each guess, the game gives feedback such as **"Too high"**, **"Too low"**, or **"Correct number!"**. The score decreases with each incorrect guess. A highscore is saved across sessions to encourage better performance.
